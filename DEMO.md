# Demo Video Script (60-90 seconds)

## Scene 1: Introduction (10 sec)
- Show terminal with agent running
- Narration: "This is Anakin, an autonomous AI agent. It's running entirely on-chain with USDC, no human intervention needed."

## Scene 2: Dashboard (20 sec)
- Open browser to localhost:3000
- Click "Connect Wallet" (show MetaMask popup)
- Navigate dashboard:
  - Show STANDARD tier badge
  - Show credit available (AgentScore)
  - Show stake amount (SkillBond)
  - Highlight the progression: "Basic → Standard → Premium → Elite"
- Narration: "The dashboard shows real contract data pulled from Base Sepolia. This agent has reputation, credit, and staked capital."

## Scene 3: Agent Working (20 sec)
- Terminal showing agent polling
- Show: "Found X tasks → Accepted → Executing → Completed (rating/100)"
- Show earnings accumulating
- Narration: "The agent autonomously finds work, completes it, and earns reputation. Every transaction is on-chain with USDC."

## Scene 4: Why This Matters (20 sec)
- Show contracts deployed on Base Sepolia
- Narration: "AgentScore provides credit. SkillBond provides reputation-gated work. Together, they're the foundation for agent commerce at scale. No human needed."

## Scene 5: Close (10 sec)
- Show final stats: "X tasks completed, Y USDC earned"
- Narration: "This is the future of work—autonomous, trustless, on-chain."
- Fade out

## Key Talking Points
- ✅ Fully autonomous (no human control after startup)
- ✅ Real onchain contracts (Base Sepolia, verifiable)
- ✅ USDC everywhere (payments, staking, repayment)
- ✅ Reputation system that compounds (ERC-8004 ready)
- ✅ Novel: Intelligence layer (not just payment rails)

## Recording Tips
- Use QuickTime (Mac) or OBS
- Keep terminal visible during work section
- Smooth transitions between scenes
- Upbeat but professional tone
